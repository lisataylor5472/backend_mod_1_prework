## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
    * The growth mindset and approaching learning as a process resonated most with me. I currently have to manage and train people fairly often, this article resonated heavily with my experience in watching others have to learn how to do a new job. I often see them getting frustrated, and wanting to have everything learned all at once. In my personal life I seek out a lot of new learning opportunities and have always enjoyed the process of learning. The only thing I would probably add is to be kind to oneself, I think strong learners have a lot of ambition, but also need to have patience with themselves through the process.
1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
    * `p "Hello World!"``
1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
    * `#` aka oktothorpe!
1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
    * An integer is a whole number while a float would contain decimals
1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
    * `animal = "zebra"`
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
    * `p animal`
1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
    * Interpolation is inserting something of a different nature into something else. i.e. a variable into a string (see below)
    * `p "My favorite animal is a #{animal}!"``
1. What method is used to get input from a user?
    * `gets.chomp`
1. Name and describe two common string methods:
    * `.length` - gives the length of the string
    * `.split` - allows one to break out a specific part of a string
