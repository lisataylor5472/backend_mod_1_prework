## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
    * What resonates most to me is the note about mistakes being essential to learning, nobody really likes making mistakes, but it's bound to happen. And people tend to remember things they learn by mistake better than they learn without having made the mistake. Just now I deleted all of my section 1 and section 2 work off of my local computer in an attempt to revert to a previous commit.... boy did I learn a lot about github real fast. An item that was brand new to me is the concept of ZPD - the zone of proximal development -- it makes sense that one needs to be challenged, but not totally overwhelmed, I had never had a term for that before.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
    * I currently am working to be better at creating SMART goals. I am terrible at it so far... I also really enjoy focusing on the process of learning. I've always enjoyed learning new things - with the caveat that they were relatively easy things to learn. I'd like to improve upon the challenging myself aspect of growth development. 

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
